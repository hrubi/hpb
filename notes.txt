build & package manager - wrapper around make

make targets:

fetch       - download source/patches
extract     - unpack source
patch       - apply patches
configure   - configure the source
build       - compile source
package     - create installable package
install     - install the package

all         - fetch extract patch configure build package


FIXME - don't rebuild dependencies if state file is already created
eg:
make extract && rm $(SRCDIR)/$(SRCPKG) && make config
should go through: fetch -> extract -> rm -> config
not through:       fetch -> extract -> rm -> fetch -> extract -> config
